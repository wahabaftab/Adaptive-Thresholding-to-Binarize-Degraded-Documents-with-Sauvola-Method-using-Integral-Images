# Adaptive-Thresholding-to-Binarize-Degraded-Documents-with-Sauvola-Method-using-Integral-Images

This repo contains a local adaptive thresholding technique to binarize degraded documents using a modified version of Sauvola Method with the use Integral Images. I took inspiration from the paper:https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.182.5334&rep=rep1&type=pdf where it's shown how Sauvola method can be made almost as much efficient as Otsu Binarization  independent of the window size without having any impact on the method's quality.
